# hello-world
Do you know legal and coding are just the same? Just a lot of words wrintten in some ways that provokes something. Mainly with if's
Is there any way some one can make this changes and merge the leagl and coding world? I mean, if they are the same... Who should do what? Lawyers lear to code or dev people lear law?
May be both...
